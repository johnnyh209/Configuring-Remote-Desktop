# Configuring-Remote-Desktop

This is a project centered around configuring and using Windows' Remote Desktop feature. Inside of this repository will contain two documentations, one for each of my attempt at setting up and using Windows' remote desktop feature.

## 1st Attempt

For this attempt, I used Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 Enterprise by way of VirtualBox.

## 2nd Attempt

For this attempt, I used Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC (both administered through VMware).
